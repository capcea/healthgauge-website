# Personalize your macro split in three steps

Balancing macros while traveling or juggling meetings is tough. We rely on three guardrails:

1. Anchor protein first—aim for 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg body weight.
2. Allocate fats to cover essential hormones and satiety (20–35% of calories).
3. Fill the rest with carbs that support your training window.

Use the [Macro Split Calculator](/calculator/macro-calculator) to translate ratios into grocery lists and weekly prep guides.
