# Welcome to Health Gauge

Health Gauge began with a simple observation: most people know *what* they want to improve—sleep, energy, body composition—but feel lost when converting goals into numbers.

Our calculators follow three principles:

1. **Transparent methods.** Each tool cites its equation so you can double-check the logic.
2. **Actionable insights.** We accompany outputs with coaching cues to help you apply the numbers.
3. **Inclusive language.** Every page ships in English and Romanian, with more languages planned.

We also curate a newsroom with analyses on nutrition policy, longevity research, and wearable tech. Expect weekly digests that balance rigor with readability.

Whether you are coaching clients or personalizing your own routine, Health Gauge keeps data, context, and trustworthy sources in one tab.
