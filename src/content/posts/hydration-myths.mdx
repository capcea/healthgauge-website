# Hydration myths that stall your performance

Sweat losses differ wildly across individuals. Some athletes shed less than 0.5 L per hour while others exceed 2 L. Yet myths persist:

- **Myth:** Thirst is always enough. **Reality:** Thirst lags behind fluid needs in hot environments.
- **Myth:** Electrolytes are only for marathons. **Reality:** Even a 60-minute strength session can deplete sodium stores in humid gyms.

Pair water with sodium sources and track body mass around training. Our [Daily Water Intake calculator](/calculator/water-intake) helps you log trends in seconds.
